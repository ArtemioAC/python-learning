# Python learning

Initial version of a Python learning journey. You will find a _notes.txt_ file that contains relevant information about the specific chapter. There will be also a python file with some code examples.

## Initial Setup

### Install Python 
I downloaded python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Usually the installer adds the python executable to the OS PATH. 

Open a terminal and type the following command in your terminal to confirm Python has been installed correctly.
```python
python --version
```  

If you get a _command not found_ message google how to add the python command to your PATH variable.

- Alternative: Use Anaconda, as mentioned in the course it includes Python and much more useful tools.

### Install a text editor or IDE of your choice

- Text editors: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
- IDE: [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
- Alternatives: 
    - Online option: https://replit.com/languages/python3
    - Anaconda/Jupyter notebooks

Any of these options will work but I would say it's better to start with a text editor to understand how run python code using a terminal. Both VS Code and Sublime Text have an integrated terminal and running code is very easy, also, they have extensions or add-ons to make code development easier.

### Install Git
Make sure you know [what is Git and how to use it](https://youtu.be/VdGzPZ31ts8). Download Git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
