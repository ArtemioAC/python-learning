# Python learning

Initial version of a Python learning journey.

## Initial Setup

### Install Python 
I downloaded python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Usually the installer adds the python executable to the OS PATH. 

Open a terminal and type the following command in your terminal to confirm Python has been installed correctly.
```python
python --version
```  

- Alternative: Use Anaconda, as mentioned in the course it includes Python and much more useful tools.

### Install a text editor or IDE of your choice

- Text editors: Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text
- IDE: PyCharm Community Edition
- Alternatives: 
    - Online option: https://replit.com/languages/python3
    - Jupyter notebooks

Any of these options will work but I would say it's better to start with a text editor to understand how run python code using a terminal. Both VS Code and Sublime Text have an integrated terminal and running code is very easy, also, they have extensions or add-ons to make code development easier.

### Install Git
Make sure you know what is Git and how to use it. Download Git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
